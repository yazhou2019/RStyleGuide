## R Style Guide
*  Philosophy of package development (Hadley Wickham): anything that can be automated, should be automated. Do as little as possible by hand. Do as much as possible with functions

### 1. Write Clean Code

(5). Tips: 
```markdown
- Use nouns for variable names and verbs for function names.
- It’s a mistake to focus on speed until you know it’ll be a problem. 

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

```

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/yazhou2019/RStyleguide/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/yazhou2019/RStyleguide/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
